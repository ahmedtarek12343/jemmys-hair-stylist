              This style works best on hair that's shoulder length and longer,
              and works particularly well with hair that has a natural wave,
              however it's not essential.Make sure you tag us on Instagram if
              you give this style a go; we'd love to see your creations! Good
              luck!

            Hi there! Welcome to our very first step-by-step styling tutorial. I
            hope I can help to inspire you to try out some different styles and
            ways to wear your hair. There's really not that much to it, once you
            see it broken down into steps! The textured bun is a great option
            for 'special event' hair when you want an up-style that doesn't look
            or feel too stiff or structured.

              The casual texture balances out the prettiness of the style,
              making it look effortless and chic.

              Lauren has literally brought my hair back from the dead. I had no
              idea how bad the condition my hair truly was until Lauren saved it
              and brought it back to life. Now my hair is the longest and
              healthiest it's ever been.
